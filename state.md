State Pattern

State pattern allows objects to behave in different ways depending on their internal state. State is used when you need a class to behave differently, such as performing slightly different computations, based on some arguments passed through to the class.

An example could be an ATM. If an ATM runs out of £10 notes it will change to offer you withdrawals of multiples of £20.
